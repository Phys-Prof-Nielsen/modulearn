    "## D2.2.1 Concept of Motion\n",
    "\n",
    "Newton’s First Law is fundamentally a conceptual statement about **motion**. \n",
    "\n",
    "It tells us that motion is not something that automatically changes on its own—something must *interact* with an object in order to change how it moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "In everyday language, we often use the word **motion** without worrying about what it actually means. We typically associate motion with *speed*—how fast something is going. While this intuition feels natural, it turns out to be incomplete from a physics point of view.\n",
    "\n",
    "To reveal this limitation, consider the following question:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Which of the following has more motion: a sedan traveling at 70 mph or a semi-truck traveling at 70 mph?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Many students initially answer that they have the same motion, since they are moving at the same speed. This response highlights a common assumption: that motion depends only on how fast an object moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Newton’s First Law invites us to think differently. If motion can only change when an unbalanced interaction occurs, then the *amount* of interaction required to stop an object tells us something meaningful about its motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now reconsider the scenario from this perspective:\n",
    "\n",
    "**A sedan and a semi-truck are both traveling at 70 mph. Which one requires a greater interaction to come to a complete stop?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Without much hesitation, most people correctly answer that the semi-truck requires a greater interaction. This intuitive response points us toward a more precise physical understanding of motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"background-color:#e6f0ff; border-left:6px solid #003366; padding:14px; border-radius:4px;\">\n",
    "<h3 style=\"margin-top:0; color:#000000;\">Key Insight</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "A more massive object has **more motion** than a less massive object moving at the same speed.  \n",
    "This shows that motion depends not only on how fast an object is moving, but also on how much matter it contains.\n",
    "\n",
    "In physics, motion is therefore linked to both **speed** and **mass**, not speed alone.\n",
    "</div>\n",

    "## D3.1.2 Reference Frame\n",
    "Building on our first discussion of motion, we used the example of a sedan and a semi-truck to argue that motion is **more than just speed**—it also depends on the mass of the moving object:\n",
    "\n",
    "**A sedan and a semi-truck are both traveling at 70 mph. Which one requires a greater interaction to come to a complete stop?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The natural conclusion was that the semi-truck requires a greater interaction. This told us that motion depends on both **how fast** an object moves and **how much matter** it contains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us now take this idea one step further.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a sailboat moving across Utah Lake with a certain motion. Suppose strong winds begin to act on the boat. Whether the boat speeds up or slows down depends not only on the strength of the interaction, but also on the **relative direction** of the wind and the boat’s motion. A tailwind increases the boat’s speed and motion, while a headwind reduces both.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example reveals an important limitation in how we have described motion so far: to fully describe changes in motion, we must also account for **direction**, not just magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, it is helpful to distinguish between two closely related ideas. Speed tells us *how fast* something is moving, but it says nothing about *which way* it is moving. To include directional information, we introduce a new quantity.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"background-color:#e6f0ff; border-left:6px solid #003366; padding:14px; border-radius:4px;\">\n",
    "<h3 style=\"margin-top:0; color:#000000;\">Velocity</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Velocity** describes how fast an object is moving **and** the direction of its motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, velocity combines **speed** with **direction**.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Mass does not depend on direction, and speed alone does not either (a car’s speedometer, for example, does not tell you which way you are traveling). Directional information enters our description of motion through velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "To describe direction in a clear and consistent way, physics requires the use of a **reference frame**, also called a **coordinate system**. A reference frame provides:\n",
    "- a chosen direction (positive and negative), and  \n",
    "- a reference point relative to which positions and motion are described.\n",
    "\n",
    "That reference point is called the **origin**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we will encounter several coordinate systems. In **Phase D**, we restrict ourselves to a **one-dimensional Cartesian system**, where direction is represented using positive and negative signs along a single line. Two- and three-dimensional Cartesian systems will be introduced in **Phase C**, and polar coordinates will appear later in **Phase B**.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we may think of these reference frames being simple, they are indeed more complex than we may think and relates to the algebra they are formulated in. Fortunately, we do not have to worry about that in this course. I suggest you read the wikipedia page on [Cartesian Coordinate System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system)\n",

For example, in the sketch below, positive numbers will represent objects that directed to the right, whereas negative numbers indicate objects directed to the left. "
