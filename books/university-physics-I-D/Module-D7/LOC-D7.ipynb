    "## Why this module matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Many physical processes involve changes that cannot be fully understood using mechanics alone. Objects warm up, cool down, expand, contract, and exchange energy with their surroundings in ways that depend on **temperature** and **thermal interactions**, not just visible forces and motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, these thermal processes do **not** lie outside the laws of physics already introduced. At the microscopic level, thermodynamic behavior arises from the same fundamental principles—**impulse, work, energy, and momentum**—acting between vast numbers of atoms and molecules. Each microscopic interaction obeys familiar physical laws; what changes is the **scale** and **collective complexity** of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module, we therefore adopt a **macroscopic, phenomenological description** of thermodynamics. Rather than tracking individual particles, we describe systems using observable quantities such as **temperature**, **heat**, **work**, and **internal energy**. These quantities allow us to account for energy transfer and storage without resolving the detailed microscopic motion that gives rise to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by introducing **temperature** as a measurable property associated with thermal equilibrium, followed by **thermal expansion**, which reveals how microscopic motion manifests as macroscopic size changes. We then define **heat** as a mode of energy transfer and examine the **mechanisms of heat transfer**. Finally, we introduce the **First Law of Thermodynamics** as a unifying principle that connects mechanical work and heat through changes in internal energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In later phases of the course, we will return to these ideas in greater depth. There, we will connect macroscopic thermodynamic laws to their microscopic origins and introduce elements of **statistical mechanics**, where probability, large numbers of particles, and—at times—quantum effects become essential. For now, the focus is on building a **coherent, energy-based framework** that remains fully consistent with fundamental physics while remaining accessible at the macroscopic level.\n",
    "\n",
    "This module establishes the conceptual foundation needed for deeper thermodynamic analysis in subsequent phases.\n",
