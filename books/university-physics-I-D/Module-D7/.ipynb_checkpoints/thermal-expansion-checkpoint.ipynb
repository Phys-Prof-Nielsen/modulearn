    "## D7.2.1 Motivation - Why thermal expansion matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Temperature is not just a number read from a thermometer—it has **direct, observable physical consequences**.  \n",
    "One of the most immediate and measurable effects of a temperature change is that materials **change their size**.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the temperature of an object increases, its microscopic constituents—atoms or molecules—undergo more vigorous **average thermal motion**. Although this motion occurs on microscopic scales, its collective effect can cause **macroscopic dimensions** such as length, area, or volume to change.\n",
    "\n",
    "This phenomenon is known as **thermal expansion**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thermal expansion provides a clear bridge between:\n",
    "- microscopic motion (invisible),\n",
    "- macroscopic behavior (measurable),\n",
    "- and engineering design (practical constraints).\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding thermal expansion is essential for explaining everyday phenomena such as:\n",
    "- gaps between railroad tracks,\n",
    "- expansion joints in bridges,\n",
    "- bimetallic strips in thermostats,\n",
    "- and stress buildup in constrained materials.\n",
