    "## Why this module matters\n",
    "\n",
    "In everyday language, motion is often described in terms of *speed* or *how fast something is going*.  \n",
    "In physics, motion is understood more deeply through how **moving matter changes** when interactions occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "This module develops that understanding step by step. We begin by introducing **momentum** as a property of moving matter. We then build toward **impulse** as the process by which momentum is transferred during an interaction. Only after that foundation is established do we introduce **force acting through time** as one specific mechanism for momentum transfer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this module, we work strictly in **one dimension**. Direction is handled using **positive and negative signs** relating to a coordinate axis, allowing us to reason carefully about motion, interactions, and conservation without additional mathematical machinery.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this sequence, momentum conservation will emerge naturally—not as a rule to memorize, but as a logical consequence of how interactions redistribute momentum within a system.\n",
