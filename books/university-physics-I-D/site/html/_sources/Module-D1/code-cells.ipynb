    "\n",
    "## D1.3.1 Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "This e-book is not just a textbook — it is an **interactive computational physics environment**.  \n",
    "Using the Thebe framework, any code cell in this book can be activated and turned into a live Python session that runs directly in your browser.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This allows you to:\n",
    "- perform calculations exactly where the physics is being discussed  \n",
    "- explore “what if?” scenarios by modifying variables  \n",
    "- visualize results immediately  \n",
    "- build confidence through experimentation  \n",
    "\n",
    "Computational reasoning grows the same way physical intuition does: by *trying things*, *changing parameters*, and *observing outcomes*.  \n",
    "The embedded code cells make this process natural and seamless.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr style=\"height:2px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## D1.3.2 Activating Live Code Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "To turn on interactive Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Scroll to the top of the page.  \n",
    "2. Click the **rocket ship icon 🚀** labeled **“Live Code”**.  \n",
    "3. All embedded code cells throughout the chapter will become active Python cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once activated, you can:\n",
    "- click inside any code cell  \n",
    "- type your own code  \n",
    "- press **Shift + Enter** (or the Run button) to execute  \n",
    "\n",
    "Behind the scenes, a lightweight Python kernel launches in your browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means:\n",
    "- no installation  \n",
    "- no setup  \n",
    "- no configuration  \n",
    "- immediate feedback  \n",
    "\n",
    "You can experiment freely. Nothing you do can break the book.\n",

    "- Click the **↺ Restart or Reset** button (depending on implementation), or  \n",
    "- Refresh the page  \n",

    "This restores the example code provided in the e-book.\n",

    "2. **Run:** Execute the cell using **Shift + Enter**. Compare the actual output with your prediction.  \n",
    "3. **Experiment:**  \n",
    "   - Change the line `y = 2 * x + 1` to something else (for example `y = x**2 + 4`).  \n",
    "   - Run the code again and observe how the output changes.  \n",

    "### 1. Treat them as “scientific scratch paper.”  \n",
    "Just like you sketch free-body diagrams or try quick algebraic steps, code cells are places to test ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Change values and observe outcomes.  \n",
    "Try doubling a mass, halving a force, changing an angle, or exploring different initial conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Use print statements to make results readable.  \n",
    "For example:  \n",
    ">`print(\"The acceleration is:\", a)`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. If something breaks — good!  \n",
    "Understanding *why* code fails is part of learning computational physics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Keep downloaded code organized.  \n",
    "If you save your files in a folder, you will naturally build your own “physics toolbox” for later phases.\n",

    "## D1.3.6 A First Look at Code Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example of what a simple code cell might look like in this book:\n",
    "\n",
    ">`# A simple physics calculation`  \n",
    ">`m = 2.0       # mass in kg`  \n",
    ">`F = 7.5       # force in newtons`  \n",
    ">`a = F / m     # acceleration in m/s^2`  \n",
    ">`print(\"Acceleration =\", a, \"m/s^2\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can change the numbers and immediately see how the acceleration changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simple experiments like this build intuition — you begin to *feel* how physics responds to changes in parameters**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to example code cells that are already filled in, this e-book also contains **DIY (Do-It-Yourself) code cells**. These cells start either partially filled or completely empty and are designed for you to **type or paste in your own Python code**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a DIY cell, you might be asked to copy an example script from the text, paste it into the cell, modify it, and then run it. This allows you to experiment freely, make mistakes, and immediately see how Python responds. Nothing you do in a DIY cell can break the book — the goal is exploration and hands-on learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "These DIY cells are especially important because **writing and running your own code is fundamentally different from just reading code**. Even small actions like copying, pasting, and running a script help build familiarity with Python syntax, structure, and problem-solving habits that are essential later in the course.\n",
