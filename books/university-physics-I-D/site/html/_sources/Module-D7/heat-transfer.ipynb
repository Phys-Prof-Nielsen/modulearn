    "The R-value measures how strongly a material **resists heat flow**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **larger R-value** means **less heat transfer** for the same temperature difference.  \n",
    "- Thicker materials have larger R-values.  \n",

    "#### Why R-value is practical\n",
    "\n",
    "Expressing conduction in terms of R-value shifts the focus from *how easily heat flows* to *how strongly a structure resists heat flow*.  \n",
    "For a fixed temperature difference, increasing the R-value directly reduces the rate of heat loss or gain, lowering heating and cooling energy demands.\n",

    "- Heat always flows from high temperature to low temperature.  \n",
    "- The three modes are **conduction, convection, and radiation**.  \n",
    "- Each has its own governing equation:  \n",
    "  - Conduction: $\\tfrac{Q}{t} = k A \\tfrac{\\Delta T}{L}$  \n",
    "  - Convection: $\\tfrac{Q}{t} = h A \\Delta T$  \n",
    "  - Radiation: $\\tfrac{Q}{t} = \\epsilon \\sigma A T^4$  \n",
    "- Real-world heat transfer often involves a combination of all three.  \n",
