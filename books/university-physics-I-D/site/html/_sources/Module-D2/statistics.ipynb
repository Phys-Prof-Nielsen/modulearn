    "## D2.6.1 Motivation — Why We Use Statistics in Physics\n",
    "\n",
    "No matter how careful we are in taking measurements, **no two measurements are exactly identical**.  \n",
    "Even the best equipment has noise, human reaction time has limits, and the environment subtly fluctuates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this, the goal in physics is **not** to find one perfect measurement, but rather to understand the **pattern** in a collection of measurements. This is where basic statistics become essential:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **mean** estimates the central value.  \n",
    "- The **median** provides a robust alternative when outliers occur.  \n",
    "- The **standard deviation** tells us how spread out the measurements are — the *precision*.  \n",
    "- The **standard error of the mean (SEM)** tells us how precisely we know the *mean itself*, improving as we take more data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Physics experiments, laboratory reports, and scientific publications all rely on these concepts.  \n",
    "Understanding them now will help you evaluate data quality, quantify confidence, and interpret results correctly.\n",
    "\n",

    "## D2.6.2 Mean\n",
    "\n",
    "The **mean** (also called the average) is the most common measure of central tendency.  \n",
    "Given $N$ measurements $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_N,$ the mean is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i\n",

    "## D2.6.3 Median\n",
    "\n",
    "The **median** is the middle value when numbers are placed in order.  \n",
    "It is especially useful when data contain **outliers**, since it is not affected by a few extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the median:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sort the data.  \n",
    "2. If $N$ is odd → choose the middle value.  \n",
    "3. If $N$ is even → take the average of the two middle values.\n",

    "## D2.6.4 Standard Deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "The **standard deviation** measures how spread out the data are from the mean.  \n",
    "In experimental physics, we almost always work with a *finite set* of measurements, not an entire population.  \n",
    "For that reason, we compute the **sample standard deviation**, defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "s = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "whereas the **population standard deviation** is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \\mu)^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between the two lies in the denominator:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **population standard deviation** uses $N$ and is only appropriate when every possible measurement in the population is known (rare in physics).\n",
    "- The **sample standard deviation** uses $N-1$.  \n",
    "  This correction, called **Bessel’s correction**, compensates for the fact that we are estimating both the mean and the spread from a limited sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because real experiments only collect a handful of measurements, the **sample standard deviation $s$** is the correct tool.  \n",
    "It quantifies the **precision** of the measurements themselves — how tightly they cluster around the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **small** $s$ means measurements are tightly grouped (high precision).  \n",
    "- A **large** $s$ means measurements vary widely (low precision).\n",
