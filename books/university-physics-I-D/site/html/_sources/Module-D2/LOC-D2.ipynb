    "## D2.0.1 Why this module matters\n",
    "Before we can analyze motion, forces, energy, or fields, we need a shared language for describing **measurements** and **evidence**. Physics is not just equations—it is the art of turning observations into trustworthy numerical claims.  \n",
    "This module builds the foundation for that art.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here you will learn how to:\n",
    "- ask testable questions using the scientific method,  \n",
    "- express quantities in consistent units,  \n",
    "- represent numbers clearly using scientific notation and significant figures,  \n",
    "- analyze repeated measurements statistically, and  \n",
    "- visualize relationships using clean, meaningful plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mastery of these tools will make all later problem solving smoother, more accurate, and more transparent—to others and to your future self.\n",
