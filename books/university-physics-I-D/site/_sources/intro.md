# A Competency Approach to University Physics I: A Compendium to the D Exam

Phase D is designed to build the core foundations needed to do physics by 
focusing on clear reasoning, quantitative thinking, and practical tools. In this phase, 
all physical situations are restricted to one dimension, allowing vectors to be treated 
as signed components rather than abstract vector objects. This simplifies the mathematics 
while emphasizing physical meaning, consistency of units, and careful interpretation of 
results. Alongside fundamental topics in mechanics, you will be introduced to basic 
computational tools using Python and Jupyter notebooks, learning how to perform calculations, 
create plots, and analyze data using simple statistics such as means and variances. 
The goal of Phase D is not advanced mathematics, but developing confidence with the 
tools and habits physicists use to model the world, check assumptions, and communicate 
quantitative ideas clearly before progressing to more complex systems in later phases.
