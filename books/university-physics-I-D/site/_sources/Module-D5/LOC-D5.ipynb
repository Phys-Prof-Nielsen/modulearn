    "## Why this module matters\n",
    "\n",
    "In Module D4, motion was analyzed without reference to acceleration or Newton’s laws. Instead, changes in motion were explained using **impulse–momentum** and **energy**, which apply broadly—even in situations where forces or accelerations vary in complicated ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module, we introduce **kinematics**, the mathematical description of motion itself. Rather than explaining *why* motion changes, kinematics focuses on **how position, velocity, and acceleration are related in time**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by defining the core kinematic quantities—**position**, **displacement**, **speed**, **velocity**, and **acceleration**—all in **one dimension**, using signed quantities to represent direction. We then derive the familiar kinematic equations for **constant acceleration**, emphasizing both their usefulness and their **limitations**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only after this foundation is established do we introduce **Newton’s second law**,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f_x = ma_x,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "not as a starting axiom, but as a **derived relationship** that emerges naturally from the **impulse–momentum theorem** under specific assumptions. In this way, acceleration becomes a **measurable consequence of interaction**, not a core physics concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, kinematics and Newton’s second law allow us to make **quantitative predictions** about motion in the past, present, and future—highlighting the **deterministic structure of Newtonian mechanics** within its domain of validity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the module, all motion is treated in **one dimension**, without vectors or calculus, preparing the ground for more general formulations introduced later in Phase B.\n",
