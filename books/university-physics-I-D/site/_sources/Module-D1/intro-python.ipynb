    "\n",
    "## D1.1.1 Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Physics is a science built on **models**, **mathematics**, and **measurement**. As systems become more complex—nonlinear forces, large datasets, realistic motion with drag, multidimensional fields—the mathematics can quickly exceed what we can do by hand. This is where computation becomes essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python has become the standard language of scientific computing** because it is:\n",
    "- Free and open-source  \n",
    "- Easy to read and write  \n",
    "- Supported by powerful scientific libraries (NumPy, SciPy, SymPy, Matplotlib)  \n",
    "- Used across research, engineering, data science, and industry  \n",
    "\n",
    "Learning Python early gives you a major advantage. It strengthens conceptual understanding, allows you to test ideas quickly, and prepares you for later phases where computation becomes a natural extension of your physics reasoning.\n",
    "\n",

    "## D1.1.2 What You Will Do in This Module\n",
    "\n",
    "In this introductory section, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learn how to activate and use the **interactive Python code cells** built directly into this e-book  \n",
    "- Use Python as a calculator to support your understanding of basic physics  \n",
    "- Write simple pseudocode to plan your calculations  \n",
    "- Learn how to solve simple equations numerically and symbolically  \n",
    "- Be exposed to additional computational tools available online  \n",
    "\n",
    "This module focuses on **comfort and familiarity**, not advanced programming. The goal is to help you start using Python as naturally as you would use a calculator or free-body diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr style=\"height:2px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## D1.1.3 Why Python Matters in Physics\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. It helps visualize and explore physics  \n",
    "You can instantly calculate trajectories, plot motion, explore “what-if” scenarios, and see how physical systems behave under changing conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. It reinforces conceptual understanding  \n",
    "Writing calculations step-by-step in code mirrors the same structure as solving problems by hand:  \n",
    "define variables → apply physics → compute → interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. It prepares you for upper-division physics  \n",
    "Mechanics, electrodynamics, quantum physics, thermodynamics, and data analysis all rely heavily on computation.  \n",
    "Even “analytical” courses now assume numerical literacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. It is a highly employable skill  \n",
    "Fields using Python include:  \n",
    "- Physics and astronomy  \n",
    "- Engineering  \n",
    "- Data science and machine learning  \n",
    "- Computational biology and chemistry  \n",
    "- Finance and economics  \n",
    "- Environmental and climate modeling  \n",
    "\n",
    "You are not just learning a tool for this course—you are learning a tool used by professionals worldwide.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr style=\"height:2px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## D1.1.4 How This Book Uses Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this course, you will find:\n",
    "- **Code cells** you can edit and run  \n",
    "- **Examples** that demonstrate physics concepts numerically  \n",
    "- **Exercises** that let you explore ideas through computation  \n",
    "- **Download buttons** to save your code for later use  \n",
    "\n",
    "You will never be required to write long programs in Phase D—only to experiment, explore, and build confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you move into Phases C, B, and A, you will gradually learn how to:\n",
    "- Create plots  \n",
    "- Write small scripts  \n",
    "- Model systems numerically  \n",
    "- Analyze real or simulated data  \n",
    "\n",
    "<hr style=\"height:2px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## D1.1.5 Final Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "You do not need prior programming experience to succeed.  \n",
    "Python is approachable, forgiving, and designed to help beginners learn quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This module will give you the foundation you need to start thinking computationally—an essential skill in modern physics.\n",
