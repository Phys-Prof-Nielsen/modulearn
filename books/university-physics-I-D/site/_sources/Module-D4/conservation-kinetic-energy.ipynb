    "## D4.5.1 Motivation — Why We Must Think in Terms of Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Conservation laws are meaningful only when we define a **system**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a **single particle**, the concept of kinetic energy conservation is trivial and uninformative:  \n",
    "a single particle cannot exchange energy with itself. Any change in its kinetic energy must come from interactions with something else.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, discussions of energy conservation must involve **at least two interacting particles**.  \n",
    "From this point forward:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lowercase symbols** (e.g., $k$, $p$) refer to individual particles  \n",
    "- **Uppercase symbols** (e.g., $K$, $P$) refer to the **total** quantities of a system\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal in this module is to understand when the **total kinetic energy of a system** remains constant during an interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr style=\"height:2px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## D4.5.2 Momentum Conservation — Why It Is Always Simpler\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall why momentum conservation works so cleanly for a two-particle system.\n",
    "\n",
    "During an interaction:\n",
    "- Each particle experiences a force due to the other\n",
    "- These forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction\n",
    "- They act over the **same time interval** $\\Delta t$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because impulse depends on force acting through **time**, the impulses delivered to the two particles are equal and opposite:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "j_{1} = -j_{2}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, the total momentum of the system,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P = p_1 + p_2,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "satisfies\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Delta P = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "whenever no external impulse acts on the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why **momentum conservation is universal** for isolated systems: the shared time interval guarantees cancellation of internal impulses.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr style=\"height:2px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## D4.5.3 Kinetic Energy — A More Subtle Quantity\n",
    "\n",
    "Kinetic energy behaves differently from momentum during interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Momentum conservation follows directly from the structure of interaction forces:  \n",
    "internal forces always come in equal and opposite pairs and act over the same time interval. As a result, momentum is automatically redistributed between particles, and the **total momentum of an isolated system is conserved**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kinetic energy does not share this automatic cancellation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Work depends on **force acting through displacement**, and for interaction forces the relevant displacement is not just the overall motion of the objects. During an interaction, forces can act through **internal displacements** caused by deformation, compression, vibration, or sticking.\n",
    "\n",
    "When internal forces act through these internal displacements, part of the work done does **not** remain as kinetic energy of motion. Instead, energy is transferred into internal forms such as:\n",
    "- deformation,\n",
    "- thermal energy,\n",
    "- sound.\n",
    "\n",
    "When this happens, the **total kinetic energy of the system decreases**, even though momentum remains conserved.\n",
    "\n",
