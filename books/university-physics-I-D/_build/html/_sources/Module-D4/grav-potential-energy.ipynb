    "## D4.6.1 Motivation — Where Does the Energy Go?\n",
    "\n",
    "In earlier sections, we saw that kinetic energy is **not always conserved**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "During some interactions, kinetic energy decreases even though momentum remains conserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "This raises a natural question:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **If kinetic energy disappears, where does the energy go?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, energy can be transferred into other forms, such as **internal energy** or **thermal energy**. These ideas are extremely important, but they require additional tools and concepts that will be developed later when we study **thermodynamics**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, we focus on a different and more immediately useful idea: **potential energy**—a way to account for energy that is stored in the configuration of a system and can be fully converted back into kinetic energy.\n",

    "Unlike kinetic energy, which depends on how fast objects move, potential energy depends on:\n",

    "## D4.6.3 Conservative Forces \n",
    "\n",
    "Some forces allow energy to be stored and recovered through changes in configuration. Such forces are called **conservative forces**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For conservative forces:\n",
    "- energy transferred by the force can be stored as potential energy,\n",
    "- that energy can later be fully converted back into kinetic energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all forces have this property. For example, friction converts energy into thermal energy in a way that cannot be fully recovered.\n",
    "\n",
    "A detailed discussion of conservative and non-conservative forces will come later in **Phases C and B**. For now, we focus on the most familiar conservative interaction: **gravity**.\n",
