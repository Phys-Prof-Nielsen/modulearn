    "## D7.5.1 Why the First Law matters\n",
    "\n",
    "In earlier modules, we introduced **energy** in a mechanical context. We learned to track changes in kinetic energy and relate them to **work** done by forces.\n",
    "\n",
    "In thermodynamics, we broaden this view. Systems can exchange energy not only through mechanical work, but also through **heat transfer**, and they can store energy internally in microscopic forms that are not directly visible as motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **First Law of Thermodynamics** provides a single, unified statement of **energy conservation** that applies to *all* physical systems—mechanical, thermal, and beyond.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr style=\"height:2px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## D7.5.2 Statement of the First Law\n",
    "\n",
    "The First Law of Thermodynamics states that the change in a system’s internal energy is equal to the energy transferred into the system as heat minus the energy transferred out of the system as work:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Delta U = Q - W.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation is not a special thermodynamic rule—it is simply **energy conservation**, written in a form that explicitly accounts for **how energy enters and leaves a system**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Internal energy **$U$ is a state variable**, meaning that $\\Delta U$ depends only on the initial and final states of the system, not on the path taken between them.\n",

    "With this definition:\n",
    "- <strong>$W > 0$</strong> corresponds to the system doing work on its surroundings (e.g., expansion).  \n",

    "- If a system absorbs heat and does no work, its internal energy increases.  \n",
    "- If a system does work without absorbing heat, its internal energy decreases.  \n",
