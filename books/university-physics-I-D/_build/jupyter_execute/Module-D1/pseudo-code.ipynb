    "## D1.5.1 Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Before writing code — in physics or in any computational field — it is essential to **understand the strategy** behind the calculation.  \n",
    "Pseudocode helps you do exactly that.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It acts as a bridge between:\n",
    "- the **conceptual physics** (identifying forces, relations, and variables), and  \n",
    "- the **computational implementation** (actual Python code).\n",
    "\n",
    "Pseudocode lets you outline your solution in clear, human-readable steps before worrying about syntax.  \n",
    "This skill becomes increasingly important as problems grow more complex in Phases C, B, and A.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## D1.5.2 What Is Pseudocode?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pseudocode is:\n",
    "- a **human-readable description** of the steps needed to solve a problem  \n",
    "- **not tied** to any programming language  \n",
    "- structured like a list of instructions  \n",
    "- focused on **logic**, not syntax  \n",
    "\n",
    "It mirrors the scientific reasoning process:\n",
    "\n",
    "**identify variables → define steps → interpret results**\n",
    "\n",
    "A good pseudocode description can be understood even by someone who does not know Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example structure:\n",
    "\n",
    ">`Define known variables`  \n",
    ">`Compute intermediate quantities`  \n",
    ">`Apply physics equations`  \n",
    ">`Output the final result`\n",

    "## D1.5.3 Why Physicists Use Pseudocode\n",
    "\n",
    "Pseudocode is widely used in scientific work because it:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Helps structure problems**\n",
    "Before coding, you force yourself to think through:\n",
    "- what you know  \n",
    "- what you need  \n",
    "- the sequence of operations  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Separates conceptual reasoning from technical implementation**\n",
    "You focus on physics first and coding second.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Reduces coding mistakes**\n",
    "You already know the plan before touching a keyboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Helps on exams and lab reports**\n",
    "Even when you cannot code, the logical structure remains the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Aids in research planning**\n",
    "Physicists outline algorithms before simulating:\n",
    "- molecular dynamics  \n",
    "- orbital motion  \n",
    "- wave propagation  \n",
    "- data processing pipelines  \n",

    "- the algebra becomes overwhelming,  \n",
    "- the physical picture becomes unclear, or  \n",
    "- the next step is not obvious.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is completely normal — <b>every physicist runs out of raw “talent” or intuition at some point</b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pseudocode provides the <b>fallback strategy</b> that keeps you moving:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Break the problem into small steps  \n",
    "2. Identify what is known and unknown  \n",
    "3. Write the logical sequence of actions  \n",
    "4. Fill in the mathematics afterward  \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is what allows scientists and engineers to tackle problems that are <i>initially beyond their vision</i>.  \n",
