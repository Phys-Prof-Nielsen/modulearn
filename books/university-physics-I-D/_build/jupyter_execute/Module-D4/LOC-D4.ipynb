    "## Why this module matters\n",
    "\n",
    "In everyday language, *work* is often described in terms of effort, fatigue, or how hard something feels to do.  \n",
    "In physics, these intuitive ideas are formalized through the concepts of **energy**, **work**, and **power**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This module develops the **work–energy framework** step by step. We begin by introducing **kinetic energy** as a scalar property associated with motion. We then define **work** as the mechanism by which energy is transferred through interactions that act over a distance. These ideas come together naturally in the **work–energy theorem**, which connects interactions to changes in motion without relying on acceleration-based reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "After establishing this foundation, we introduce **gravitational potential energy** as a stored form of energy associated with position. This allows us to distinguish between **conservative** interactions, which store energy, and **non-conservative** interactions, which transfer energy into or out of mechanical energy. These ideas are unified through the concept of **mechanical energy**, which provides a powerful bookkeeping tool for understanding motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "We conclude the module with **power**, which describes how quickly energy is transferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this module, all motion and interactions are treated in **one dimension**, with direction handled using **signed quantities**. Energy itself remains a **scalar**, allowing us to focus on physical interpretation, energy transfer, and conservation rather than mathematical complexity.\n",
