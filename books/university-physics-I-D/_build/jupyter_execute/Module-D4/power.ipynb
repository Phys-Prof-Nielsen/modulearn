    "## D4.8.1 Motivation — How Fast Is Energy Transferred?\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have focused on **how much energy** is transferred to or from a system through work.  \n",
    "However, in many real situations, an equally important question is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **How fast does that energy transfer occur?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Two machines may both transfer the same amount of energy, but if one does so in half the time, we experience it as being *more powerful*.  \n",
    "This distinction matters in contexts ranging from engines and motors to human performance and electrical devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "To capture this idea, we introduce a new quantity: **power**.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{W_{\\text{net}}}{\\Delta t}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance, this expression may look slightly uncomfortable from a **mathematical point of view**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are used to defining rates as a **ratio of changes**, such as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t}\n",
    "\\quad \\text{or} \\quad\n",

    "$$\n",
    "P_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{W_{\\text{net}}}{\\Delta t}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "appears to place a single quantity in the numerator rather than a difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "This apparent asymmetry is what makes the definition feel uncomfortable to the mathematical eye.\n",

    "The resolution comes from remembering what **work actually represents**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Work is not an independent state variable—it is *already a change*.  \n",
    "Specifically, work is the **change in kinetic energy**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "W_{\\text{net}} = \\Delta k.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which has the familiar and expected structure of a **ratio of differences**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The definition is therefore mathematically consistent; the change is simply embedded in the definition of work itself. Writing power in terms of work emphasizes the physical process of **energy transfer**, while writing it in terms of $\\Delta k$ makes the mathematical structure explicit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later, in Phase B, this structure will be made fully transparent using calculus, where instantaneous power is defined as\n",

    "$$\n",
