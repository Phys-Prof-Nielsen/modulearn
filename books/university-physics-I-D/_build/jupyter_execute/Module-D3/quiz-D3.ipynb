If size/shape do not matter for the dynamics of interest, the point-particle model is appropriate.\"}, {\"answer\": \"The object literally has zero size and occupies no space.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Not correct. 'Point particle' is a modeling assumption, not a literal physical claim.\"}, {\"answer\": \"The object is microscopic (like an electron).\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Not necessarily. Many macroscopic objects can be treated as point particles if size/shape do not matter.\"}, {\"answer\": \"The object experiences no forces.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Not correct. Point-particle modeling is about ignoring size/shape, not about eliminating forces.\"}]}, {\"question\": \"In 1D motion, which statement best describes the difference between speed and velocity\", \"type\": \"multiple_choice\", \"answers\": [{\"answer\": \"Speed has no direction; velocity includes direction through a sign (+/-).\", \"correct\": true, \"feedback\": \"Correct.

Momentum depends on the observer, but the change from an interaction is agreed upon in this Newtonian context.\"}, {\"answer\": \"All observers always measure the same momentum for the same object.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Not correct. Momentum depends on measured velocity, which depends on the observer.\"}, {\"answer\": \"All observers always measure the same velocity for the same object.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Not correct.

The impulse over that interval is...\", \"type\": \"multiple_choice\", \"answers\": [{\"answer\": \"Negative.\", \"correct\": true, \"feedback\": \"Correct. Signed area below the axis is negative.\"}, {\"answer\": \"Positive.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Not correct. Area below the axis gives negative impulse.\"}, {\"answer\": \"Zero.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Not correct. Zero impulse would require zero net area.\"}, {\"answer\": \"Undefined.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Not correct. Impulse is well-defined as area under the curve.\"}]}, {\"question\": \"Net impulse from multiple forces is best described by which statement?\", \"type\": \"multiple_choice\", \"answers\": [{\"answer\": \"Net impulse is the sum of individual impulses: j_{net,x} = sum j_x.\", \"correct\": true, \"feedback\": \"Correct. Always start with summing impulses.\"}, {\"answer\": \"Net impulse is always sum (f_x \\u0394t) even if forces act for different times.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Not correct. You can only factor out one \\u0394t if the forces act over the same time interval.\"}, {\"answer\": \"Net impulse depends only on the largest force.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Not correct. Impulse depends on force and duration (area).\"}, {\"answer\": \"Net impulse is the same as net force.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Not correct. Net impulse includes time; net force does not.\"}]}, {\"question\": \"Which condition is required to use j_{net,x} = f_{net,x} \\u0394t directly?\", \"type\": \"multiple_choice\", \"answers\": [{\"answer\": \"All contributing forces act over the same time interval \\u0394t (or share a common interval).\", \"correct\": true, \"feedback\": \"Correct. Otherwise you must sum impulses over each force\\u2019s own duration.\"}, {\"answer\": \"All forces must be positive.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Not correct. Forces can be positive or negative.\"}, {\"answer\": \"The object must be at rest initially.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Not correct. Initial motion does not determine whether the formula applies.\"}, {\"answer\": \"The mass must be 1 kg.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Not correct. Mass does not need to be 1 kg.\"}]}, {\"question\": \"Why do internal impulses cancel when summing over a two-particle system during an interaction?\", \"type\": \"multiple_choice\", \"answers\": [{\"answer\": \"Newton\\u2019s Third Law gives equal-and-opposite internal forces acting over the same interaction time.\", \"correct\": true, \"feedback\": \"Correct. Equal-and-opposite forces over the same time give equal-and-opposite impulses.\"}, {\"answer\": \"Because internal forces are always zero.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Not correct. Internal forces are typically nonzero during interactions.\"}, {\"answer\": \"Because masses are equal.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Not correct. Cancellation does not require equal masses.\"}, {\"answer\": \"Because velocity is the same for both particles.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Not correct. Particles can have different velocities.\"}]}, {\"question\": \"Conservation of momentum for a system is guaranteed when...\", \"type\": \"multiple_choice\", \"answers\": [{\"answer\": \"The net external impulse on the system is zero.\", \"correct\": true, \"feedback\": \"Correct. Zero external impulse means total system momentum stays constant.\"}, {\"answer\": \"The net internal impulse on the system is zero.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Not correct. Internal impulse cancellation happens automatically, but conservation requires zero external impulse.\"}, {\"answer\": \"The net external force is zero at one instant.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Not correct. Conservation depends on net external impulse over the interaction time, not a single instant.\"}, {\"answer\": \"Both objects have the same mass.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Not correct. Conservation does not require equal masses.\"}]}, {\"question\": \"In 1D, if p_x is negative, that most directly means...\", \"type\": \"multiple_choice\", \"answers\": [{\"answer\": \"The particle\\u2019s motion is in the negative x-direction.\", \"correct\": true, \"feedback\": \"Correct. Sign indicates direction along the chosen axis.\"}, {\"answer\": \"The particle has negative mass.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Not correct. Mass is positive in this course.\"}, {\"answer\": \"The particle is slowing down.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Not necessarily. Negative momentum can be speeding up or slowing down depending on the situation.\"}, {\"answer\": \"The particle\\u2019s speed must be zero.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Not correct. Negative momentum can have nonzero speed.\"}]}, {\"question\": \"Which statement best contrasts impulse\\u2013momentum with work\\u2013energy?\", \"type\": \"multiple_choice\", \"answers\": [{\"answer\": \"Impulse involves force acting through time; work involves force acting through displacement.\", \"correct\": true, \"feedback\": \"Correct. This difference is why momentum conservation behaves differently than energy accounting.\"}, {\"answer\": \"Impulse and work are the same quantity with different names.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Not correct. They are fundamentally different.\"}, {\"answer\": \"Impulse depends on displacement; work depends on time.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Not correct. It\\u2019s the opposite.\"}, {\"answer\": \"Impulse has units of joules; work has units of newtons.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Not correct.
