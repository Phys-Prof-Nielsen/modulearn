    "\n",
    "**Mass** is one of those concepts that feels familiar in everyday life, yet turns out to be surprisingly subtle in physics. Depending on the physical framework being used, mass can be understood in different ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. As a measure of resistance to changes in **linear motion**  \n",
    "   (the Newtonian concept of **inertial mass**).\n",
    "2. As a measure of the **amount of matter** in an object  \n",
    "   (common in chemistry and materials science).\n",
    "3. Through mass–energy equivalence in relativity, where mass and energy influence the curvature of spacetime.\n",
    "4. As a parameter arising from interactions between quantum fields (e.g., the Higgs mechanism in particle physics).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we restrict our discussion to the **first two interpretations**, which are sufficient for introductory mechanics. The remaining perspectives belong to more advanced physics, but they are worth mentioning to emphasize that mass is a deeply fundamental—and fascinating—concept.\n",

    "### What Do We Mean by a *Point Mass*?\n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance, the idea of a *point mass* may seem unphysical. Objects in our everyday world have size and shape, and even fundamental particles are not literally mathematical points.\n",
    "\n",
    "In mechanics, however, a **point mass** is not meant to describe physical size. Instead, it is a **modeling assumption** that builds directly on the idea of a point particle introduced earlier.\n",

    "A **point mass** is a point particle to which a mass is assigned, under the assumption that the object’s size and shape do not affect the motion being analyzed.\n",
    "</div>\n",

    "This means that many real objects—cars, balls, pucks, or even planets—can be treated as point masses **as long as their size, shape, and internal structure do not influence the dynamics of interest**.\n",

    "\n",
    "In Newtonian mechanics, mass is defined operationally through how an object responds to interactions. From Newton’s second law (under appropriate assumptions), mass is given by\n",
    "\n",

    "m = \\frac{\\sum F}{a}\n",

    "> **Mass measures an object’s resistance to changes in motion.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, mass defined in this way is called **inertial mass**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To date, no experiment has shown any difference between inertial mass and other notions of mass (such as gravitational mass). While classical physics allows for the possibility of distinct definitions, modern physics—particularly general relativity—shows that these concepts are fundamentally equivalent.\n",

    "The two interpretations of mass that we do <em>not</em> explore in this course are actually the deepest physical explanations.  \n",
