    "Although it is one of the most famous equations in physics—perhaps second only to $E = mc^2$ — it is not the most fundamental starting point for understanding motion. By beginning instead with the impulse–momentum theorem and the work–energy framework, we have focused on principles that are more general, more robust, and less likely to be misapplied. These approaches emphasize how interactions change motion through momentum transfer and energy exchange, without immediately tying those changes to acceleration.\n",
    "\n",
    "This choice is also very much in the spirit of [The Feynman Lectures on Physics](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/), which I am a big fan of. Feynman consistently emphasizes that the most powerful laws of physics are those that remain valid across many situations, even if they are not always the most familiar. In that perspective, momentum and energy play a more fundamental role than $f_x = ma_x$, which emerges only under specific assumptions.\n",

    "In this module, we will now show how the familiar form $f_x = ma_x$ arises naturally from the impulse–momentum theorem when mass is constant. The goal is not to elevate $f_x = ma_x$ above other principles, but to understand precisely when it works, why it works, and when it does not—so that acceleration can be used responsibly as a tool for predicting motion in kinematics.\n",
