Displacement is change in position with sign (direction) in 1D.\"}, {\"answer\": \"Always equal to the total distance traveled.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Incorrect. Distance traveled is always nonnegative and depends on the path.\"}, {\"answer\": \"Always positive because it measures how far something moved.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Incorrect. Displacement can be negative in 1D.\"}, {\"answer\": \"A quantity that has no direction because it is measured in meters.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Incorrect. In 1D we encode direction using sign.\"}]}, {\"question\": \"A cart moves from x = +2 m to x = -5 m.\\n\\nWhich statement is true?\", \"type\": \"multiple_choice\", \"answers\": [{\"answer\": \"The displacement is negative.\", \"correct\": true, \"feedback\": \"Correct. Delta x = -5 - (+2) = -7 m (negative).\"}, {\"answer\": \"The displacement is positive.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Incorrect. Final position is less than initial position.\"}, {\"answer\": \"The distance traveled must be -7 m.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Incorrect. Distance traveled cannot be negative.\"}, {\"answer\": \"The average velocity must be positive.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Incorrect. Average velocity has the same sign as displacement if time is positive.\"}]}, {\"question\": \"Which statement best distinguishes speed from velocity in 1D?\", \"type\": \"multiple_choice\", \"answers\": [{\"answer\": \"Speed is the magnitude of velocity and is never negative.\", \"correct\": true, \"feedback\": \"Correct. Speed is always nonnegative; velocity can be positive or negative.\"}, {\"answer\": \"Speed and velocity are always the same in 1D.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Incorrect. They differ when velocity is negative.\"}, {\"answer\": \"Velocity has units of meters, speed has units of meters per second.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Incorrect. Both have units of meters per second.\"}, {\"answer\": \"Speed includes direction, velocity does not.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Incorrect. Velocity includes direction (sign); speed does not.\"}]}, {\"question\": \"A positive acceleration in 1D means:\", \"type\": \"multiple_choice\", \"answers\": [{\"answer\": \"The velocity becomes more positive (or less negative) as time passes.\", \"correct\": true, \"feedback\": \"Correct. Positive acceleration increases v_x.\"}, {\"answer\": \"The object must be moving in the positive direction.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Incorrect. An object can move in -x while having + acceleration (slowing down).\"}, {\"answer\": \"The speed must be increasing.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Incorrect. Speed can decrease if velocity is negative and acceleration is positive.\"}, {\"answer\": \"The position must always be positive.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Incorrect. Position can be negative even with positive acceleration.\"}]}, {\"question\": \"When is it valid to use the standard constant-acceleration kinematics equations?\", \"type\": \"multiple_choice\", \"answers\": [{\"answer\": \"When acceleration is approximately constant over the time interval.\", \"correct\": true, \"feedback\": \"Correct. The equations assume constant acceleration.\"}, {\"answer\": \"Whenever velocity is changing.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Incorrect. Changing velocity alone does not guarantee constant acceleration.\"}, {\"answer\": \"Only when the object moves in the positive direction.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Incorrect. The equations work in either direction if acceleration is constant.\"}, {\"answer\": \"Only when the net force is zero.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Incorrect. Net force zero means acceleration zero, but the equations are more general.\"}]}, {\"question\": \"Torricelli's equation is most useful when:\", \"type\": \"multiple_choice\", \"answers\": [{\"answer\": \"You want to relate velocity and displacement without using time.\", \"correct\": true, \"feedback\": \"Correct. It eliminates time.\"}, {\"answer\": \"You want to find time but do not know acceleration.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Incorrect. Torricelli\\u2019s equation requires acceleration.\"}, {\"answer\": \"Acceleration is changing rapidly with time.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Incorrect. It assumes constant acceleration.\"}, {\"answer\": \"You want to compute force from mass and momentum.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Incorrect. That\\u2019s impulse\\u2013momentum / Newton\\u2019s second law territory.\"}]}, {\"question\": \"In this course, why did we delay introducing F = ma?\", \"type\": \"multiple_choice\", \"answers\": [{\"answer\": \"To first focus on more general principles like impulse\\u2013momentum and work\\u2013energy.\", \"correct\": true, \"feedback\": \"Correct. Those principles are more general and harder to misuse.\"}, {\"answer\": \"Because F = ma is wrong in all situations.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Incorrect. It works well for constant-mass systems in many cases.\"}, {\"answer\": \"Because acceleration is not a real physical quantity.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Incorrect. Acceleration is measurable and useful.\"}, {\"answer\": \"Because kinematics never uses acceleration.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Incorrect. Kinematics heavily uses acceleration (especially with constant a).\"}]}, {\"question\": \"Why can F = ma fail for variable-mass systems (like rockets)?\", \"type\": \"multiple_choice\", \"answers\": [{\"answer\": \"Because momentum changes can come from changes in mass as well as changes in velocity.\", \"correct\": true, \"feedback\": \"Correct. Delta(mv) is not the same as m Delta v when m changes.\"}, {\"answer\": \"Because Newton's laws only work in 2D and 3D.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Incorrect. Newton\\u2019s laws apply in 1D too.\"}, {\"answer\": \"Because force cannot act on an object with changing mass.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Incorrect. Forces still act; the accounting must be done carefully.\"}, {\"answer\": \"Because acceleration is always zero when mass changes.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Incorrect. Acceleration can be nonzero in variable-mass motion.\"}]}, {\"question\": \"If multiple forces act on a particle at the same time, the net force is:\", \"type\": \"multiple_choice\", \"answers\": [{\"answer\": \"The sum of all forces acting along x (with signs).\", \"correct\": true, \"feedback\": \"Correct. Net force is the signed sum in 1D.\"}, {\"answer\": \"Always the largest force only.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Incorrect. Smaller forces still contribute to the sum.\"}, {\"answer\": \"Always zero if there are at least two forces.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Incorrect. Two forces can add to something nonzero.\"}, {\"answer\": \"The average of the forces.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Incorrect. Net force is a sum, not an average.\"}]}, {\"question\": \"A particle has negative velocity and positive acceleration. Which is definitely true?\", \"type\": \"multiple_choice\", \"answers\": [{\"answer\": \"The velocity is becoming less negative as time increases.\", \"correct\": true, \"feedback\": \"Correct. Positive acceleration pushes velocity upward.\"}, {\"answer\": \"The particle is speeding up.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Incorrect. It may be slowing down (speed decreasing) if v is negative.\"}, {\"answer\": \"The particle must be moving to the right.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Incorrect. Negative velocity means left (in the chosen sign convention).\"}, {\"answer\": \"The displacement must be positive.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Incorrect. Displacement depends on position change, not on acceleration alone.\"}]}, {\"question\": \"If the impulse on a particle is positive, what can you conclude about the change in momentum?\", \"type\": \"multiple_choice\", \"answers\": [{\"answer\": \"The change in momentum is positive.\", \"correct\": true, \"feedback\": \"Correct. Impulse equals change in momentum.\"}, {\"answer\": \"The final momentum must be positive.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Incorrect. Momentum can still be negative if it started negative with larger magnitude.\"}, {\"answer\": \"The force must have been negative.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Incorrect. Positive impulse corresponds to net force in +x over the interval.\"}, {\"answer\": \"The particle must be moving in the +x direction the whole time.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Incorrect. Motion direction can change during the interaction.\"}]}, {\"question\": \"Which statement about g's (as used in this course) is correct?\", \"type\": \"multiple_choice\", \"answers\": [{\"answer\": \"Number of g's is the magnitude of acceleration divided by 9.81 m/s^2.\", \"correct\": true, \"feedback\": \"Correct. g-load is |a|/9.81.\"}, {\"answer\": \"Number of g's is acceleration times 9.81.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Incorrect. It is a ratio, not a product.\"}, {\"answer\": \"Number of g's is always 1 for any moving object.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Incorrect. It depends on acceleration magnitude.\"}, {\"answer\": \"g's can only be used for vertical motion.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Incorrect. It\\u2019s just a convenient acceleration unit.\"}]}, {\"question\": \"If a particle slows down while moving in the +x direction, the acceleration is:\", \"type\": \"multiple_choice\", \"answers\": [{\"answer\": \"Negative.\", \"correct\": true, \"feedback\": \"Correct. Acceleration opposite the velocity reduces speed.\"}, {\"answer\": \"Positive.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Incorrect. Positive acceleration would tend to increase +x velocity.\"}, {\"answer\": \"Zero.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Incorrect. If speed changes, acceleration is not zero.\"}, {\"answer\": \"Impossible to determine without mass.\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Incorrect. Sign comes from velocity change, not mass.\"}]}, {\"question\": \"Which pair of equations is a correct strategy for solving 'find final velocity and displacement' with constant acceleration?\", \"type\": \"multiple_choice\", \"answers\": [{\"answer\": \"v = v0 + a t and x = x0 + v0 t + 0.5 a t^2\", \"correct\": true, \"feedback\": \"Correct. These are the standard constant-acceleration equations.\"}, {\"answer\": \"p = mv and j = F x\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Incorrect. Those are momentum and an incorrect work expression.\"}, {\"answer\": \"v^2 = v0^2 + 2 a t and x = v t\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Incorrect. v^2 equation does not use time that way; x = v t requires constant v.\"}, {\"answer\": \"F = ma and x = 0.5 m v^2\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Incorrect. The second equation is not a kinematics relation.\"}]}, {\"question\": \"A cart starts from rest and accelerates at 2.0 m/s^2 for 6.0 s.\\n\\nWhat is the final velocity?\", \"type\": \"multiple_choice\", \"answers\": [{\"answer\": \"12 m/s\", \"correct\": true, \"feedback\": \"Correct. v = 0 + (2.0)(6.0) = 12.\"}, {\"answer\": \"6 m/s\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Incorrect. You forgot the acceleration factor.\"}, {\"answer\": \"24 m/s\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Incorrect. That would be (4)(6).\"}, {\"answer\": \"3 m/s\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Incorrect.

The velocity decreased, so a is negative.\"}, {\"answer\": \"-6.0 m/s^2\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Incorrect. You did not divide by time.\"}, {\"answer\": \"+6.0 m/s^2\", \"correct\": false, \"feedback\": \"Incorrect.
