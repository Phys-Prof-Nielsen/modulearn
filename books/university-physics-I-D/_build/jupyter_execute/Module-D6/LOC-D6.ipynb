    "## Why this module matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Many physical systems—ranging from mechanical vibrations and sound to light and quantum phenomena—exhibit **repetitive behavior**. This repetition can occur **in time**, as in oscillatory motion, or **in both space and time**, as in traveling waves.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module, we introduce **oscillations and traveling waves** as **patterns of motion**, characterized by a small set of descriptive parameters. Rather than explaining *why* these motions occur, we focus on **how they are described**, **recognized**, and **interpreted**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin with **oscillatory motion**, introducing frequency-based descriptions that quantify repetition in time. We then extend these ideas to **traveling waves**, where repetition occurs across space as well as time. Throughout the module, motion is described using **given mathematical forms**, without derivation, emphasizing **physical meaning**, **parameter interpretation**, and **graphical understanding**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This module prepares the conceptual ground for later phases, where calculus-based tools will be introduced to explain how these motions arise from underlying physical laws.\n",
