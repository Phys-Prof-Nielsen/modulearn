    "## D7.3.1 Motivation\n",
    "When two objects at different temperatures are placed in contact, energy flows from the hotter one to the colder one. This energy in transit is called **heat**.  \n",
    "It is important to emphasize that **heat is not the same as temperature**:  \n",
    "- Temperature is a measure of the thermal state of a system (related to particle motion).  \n",
    "- Heat is the **energy transferred** because of a temperature difference.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In thermodynamics, heat is treated in the same family as **work**.  \n",
    "- **Mechanical work** is energy transferred by a force acting through a distance:\n",
    "   \n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  W = f_x \\cdot d_x\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Heat** is energy transferred because of a **temperature difference**, often through microscopic collisions of particles.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Both are forms of **energy transfer**, not stored substances. A system can have internal energy, but it does not \"contain heat\" any more than it \"contains work.\" Instead, heat and work are ways energy moves in or out of a system.\n",

    "## D7.3.2 Heat and Specific Heat Capacity\n",
    "When an object is heated and its temperature changes (but no phase change occurs), the amount of heat absorbed or released is proportional to its mass, its temperature change, and a material property called **specific heat capacity**:\n",

    "$$\n",

    "- $c$ = specific heat capacity ($\\mathrm{J/(kg \\cdot K)}$)  \n",
    "- $\\Delta T$ = temperature change (K or °C). Because temperature differences are independent of zero-point offsets, a change of 1 K is identical to a change of 1°C.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens to this energy?  \n",
    "The energy goes primarily into the **microscopic motion of particles**:  \n",
    "- Translational motion (particles moving faster)  \n",
    "- Rotational and vibrational modes (in molecules)  \n",
    "- Small contributions to electronic states at high temperatures  \n",
    "\n",
    "This is why temperature rises — it reflects an increase in the average thermal energy associated with microscopic motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "A material with a large $c$ (like water) requires more heat to achieve the same temperature change, because it can store more energy in these microscopic motions compared to a material with small $c$ (like metals).\n",
