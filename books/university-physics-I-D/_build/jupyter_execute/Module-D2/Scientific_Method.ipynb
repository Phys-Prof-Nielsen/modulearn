Even when an experiment appears simple, issues such as reaction time, bias, and instrument precision can dramatically change the conclusion. This naturally motivates the next topics in our scientific toolkit: significant figures and the basic handling of data, including the mean, median, standard deviation, and standard error of the mean. These tools allow us to quantify uncertainty, summarize variability, and communicate results honestly and transparently. Before we can trust or interpret any measurement, we must know not just the number itself—but how reliable that number truly is.\n",
