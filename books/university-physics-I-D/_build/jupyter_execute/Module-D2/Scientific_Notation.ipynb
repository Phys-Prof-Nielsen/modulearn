    "\n",
    "In science, numbers are rarely just numbers — they carry meaning about scale, precision, and uncertainty. Whether we measure the diameter of an atom or the distance to a galaxy, we must communicate those values in a way that is clear, unambiguous, and scientifically honest. Scientific notation is the standard used by physicists for this exact reason: it makes the size of a number immediately obvious and reveals the number of significant figures, preventing misunderstandings about the precision of a measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scientific notation expresses a number using a coefficient whose absolute value is between $x: 1 \\le |x| < 10$, multiplied by a power of ten. This compact structure is not only convenient — it is the language through which scientists communicate reliably. By mastering this notation now, you build the foundation needed for meaningful comparisons, accurate calculations, and transparent reporting of data throughout the rest of the course (and the rest of physics).\n",

As a scientist in perpetual training, you already rely on tools such as pen and paper, calculators, and whiteboards, but **no scientific tool is more essential today than a computer and the ability to use it confidently**.  \n",

    "In this course, you will frequently use the computer to solve problems, analyze data, and explore physics. We will learn these skills through examples, and with practice, you will become comfortable and capable using Python for scientific work.\n",

    "Python also understands and uses scientific notation exactly as we have described mathematically. You can write a number in scientific notation or in standard decimal form, and Python will interpret them as the same value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "> `a = 12.5`  \n",
    "> `b = 1.25e1`  \n",
    "> `print(a, b)`\n",

    "All of these methods force Python to express the number in scientific notation and let you specify how many digits to display.\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with scientific notation in Python, the most useful and widely recommended method—especially in physics—is to use f-strings such as `f\"{x:.3e}\"`. This approach makes the numerical format and level of precision immediately visible in the code and ensures that results are displayed with clear, unambiguous scientific meaning. Engineers often use either f-strings or the older `format()` function, since both allow controlled, fixed-width formatting for tables and technical reports. In large-scale scientific computing or data analysis, NumPy’s formatting tools (such as `np.format_float_scientific`) are preferred because they handle arrays consistently and reliably. Although Python accepts scientific notation as input, explicitly formatting the output—most cleanly with f-strings—provides the clarity and precision required for rigorous scientific communication.\n",

    "* present very large or small numbers consistently  \n",
    "* avoid ambiguity in lab reports and coding tasks  \n",
