    "## D2.4.7 Fermi Estimates — Thinking Like a Physicist\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Fermi estimate** is a quick, order-of-magnitude approximation of a quantity that is difficult or impossible to measure directly.  \n",
    "Instead of exact data, we rely on:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simple physical reasoning  \n",
    "- Reasonable assumptions  \n",
    "- Breaking a complex problem into simpler pieces  \n",
    "- Order-of-magnitude arithmetic (powers of ten)\n",
    "\n",
    "Fermi estimation is named after physicist **Enrico Fermi**, famous for obtaining surprisingly accurate results with very limited information. It is one of the most powerful mental tools in physics because it teaches you to approximate, validate your intuition, and notice when answers are *way off*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why We Use Fermi Estimates\n",
    "Fermi problems help us:\n",
    "- Build intuition for the scale of physical quantities.  \n",
    "- Check whether a more detailed calculation is reasonable.  \n",
    "- Avoid “nonsense answers” (e.g., densities larger than neutron stars in an intro physics problem).  \n",
    "- Understand which assumptions matter and which details you can ignore.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Basic Approach \n",
    "1. **Break the problem into parts**\n",
    "\n",
    "   For example, to estimate the number of piano tuners in Chicago (a famous Fermi problem), you might estimate  \n",
    "   population → households → pianos per household → tunings per year → tunings a tuner can do.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Use round, convenient numbers**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Replace exact values with powers of ten for speed and clarity:\n",
    "   - Instead of 312,000,000 people → use $3\\times10^8$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multiply your estimates**\n",
    "\n",
    "   You will often get a final result accurate within a factor of 2–10, which is *excellent* for an order-of-magnitude estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Report the answer as an order of magnitude**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: $7\\times10^{24}~\\text{kg}$ is the same order of magnitude as $10^{25}~\\text{kg}$.\n",

    "<h3 style=\"margin-top:0; color:#000000;\">Example — Fermi Estimate of the Radius of the Earth</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the classic “Fermi thinking” exercises is estimating the size of the Earth *without* using Google, formulas, or scientific constants.  \n",
    "Surprisingly — it’s possible with nothing more than everyday facts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1 — Use what we know about time zones**\n",
    "Most people know:\n",
    "- There are **24 time zones** around the Earth.\n",
    "- One time zone corresponds to **1 hour** difference in local time.\n",
    "- In 1 hour the Earth rotates through one-twenty-fourth of a full circle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "1\\ \\text{time zone} \\approx \\frac{360^\\circ}{24} = 15^\\circ.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2 — Use a familiar distance between two cities**\n",
    "Pick two cities you know the approximate distance between, *and* know that they are roughly one time zone apart.  \n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- New York to Chicago is about **1 time zone** apart.\n",
    "- The distance is roughly **1,000 km** (common-knowledge round number: “it’s about a 2-hour flight”).\n",
    "\n",
    "So:  \n",
    "15° of Earth’s circumference ≈ 1,000 km.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3 — Scale up to the full circumference**\n",
