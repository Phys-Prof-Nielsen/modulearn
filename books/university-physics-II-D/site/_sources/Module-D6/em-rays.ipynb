    "# D6.2 Electromagnetic Waves as Rays \n",
    "\n",
    "<hr style=\"height:2px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## D6.2.1 Learning Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:\n",
    "- Understand that light is an electromagnetic wave.\n",
    "- Explain when and why we can approximate light as a **ray**.\n",
    "- Describe key concepts like **wavefronts**, **rays**, and **the high-frequency limit**.\n",
    "- Recognize real-world systems where this approximation is valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr style=\"height:2px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## D6.2.2 What Is Light?\n",
    "\n",
    "Light is an **electromagnetic (EM) wave** — a self-sustaining oscillation of **electric and magnetic fields** traveling through space.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It propagates at the **speed of light**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$ c = 3 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The electric and magnetic fields are **perpendicular** to each other and to the direction of motion — a **transverse wave**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- All visible colors, infrared, ultraviolet, X-rays, and radio waves are part of the **electromagnetic spectrum**.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr style=\"height:2px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## D6.2.3 Wavefronts and Rays\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **wavefront** is a surface of constant phase (like the crest of a wave).  \n",
    "  → Think of it as the \"leading edge\" of the wave.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **ray** is a line **perpendicular to the wavefront**, indicating the **direction of energy flow**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In uniform media, **rays travel in straight lines**. In non-uniform media, rays bend — this is the basis for **refraction**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key idea**: Rays are not physical objects — they are **mathematical abstractions** that show how energy moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr style=\"height:2px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## D6.2.4 When Can We Treat Light as a Ray?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can simplify light as rays when:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **wavelength** is much smaller than the size of objects it interacts with:  \n",
    "\n",
    "  $$ \\lambda \\ll L $$\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is **no significant interference or diffraction**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is known as the **geometrical optics limit** or **eikonal approximation** — a high-frequency limit of wave optics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Valid scenarios:**\n",
    "- Lenses and mirrors in imaging systems\n",
    "- Laser beams in air\n",
    "- Reflection/refraction at flat surfaces\n",
    "- Even some **interference effects**, if we only track the ray paths and consider their phase shifts\n",
    "\n",
    "> Thin film interference will be a **ray-based application** of wave principles — tracking the paths, angles, and phase changes of reflected rays.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr style=\"height:2px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## D6.2.5 Rays from Maxwell's Equations (Without Derivation)\n",
    "\n",
    "While we won't dive into the full Maxwell equations yet, it's helpful to know this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Maxwell’s equations predict **wave solutions** for electric and magnetic fields.\n",
    "- These fields satisfy the **wave equation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$ \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{E} - \\frac{1}{c^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t^2} = 0 $$\n",
    "  \n",
    "- In the **short-wavelength limit**, these wavefronts behave like **geometrical surfaces** and rays emerge **perpendicular** to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "So ray optics is not a separate theory — it's an **approximation** of full electromagnetic theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr style=\"height:2px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## D6.2.6 Fermat’s Principle of Least Time\n",
    "\n",
    "A foundational idea in ray optics is **Fermat’s Principle**:\n",
    "> *Light takes the path that requires the least time.*\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to:\n",
    "- **Straight-line paths** in uniform media\n",
    "- **Snell's Law** in layered materials\n",
    "- **Reflection and refraction rules** that we’ll explore in detail later\n",
    "\n",
    "This principle is the **ray-optics analog** of how nature \"optimizes\" energy and time — and it's a stepping stone toward **variational principles** in physics.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr style=\"height:2px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## D6.2.7 Where Does This Take Us?\n",
    "\n",
    "From this foundation, we’ll explore:\n",
    "- How light **reflects** from surfaces\n",
    "- How it **refracts** (bends) when moving between media\n",
    "- How to construct optical paths using **ray diagrams**\n",
    "- How lenses, mirrors, prisms, and fiber optics are designed using **ray models**\n",
    "\n",
    "Later, in **Phase C and A**, we’ll return to the full wave nature of light to understand:\n",
    "- Diffraction\n",
    "- Interference\n",
    "- Polarization\n",
    "- Waveguides and wavefront engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr style=\"height:2px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## D6.2.8 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- Light is an electromagnetic wave, but in many situations, we can treat it as traveling in straight **rays**.\n",
    "- This approximation works when the **wavelength is small** compared to the system.\n",
    "- Rays are **perpendicular to wavefronts** and represent the **direction of energy propagation**.\n",
    "- This approach allows us to predict and understand **reflection**, **refraction**, **image formation**, and **optical design** — which are the focus of ray optics.\n",
