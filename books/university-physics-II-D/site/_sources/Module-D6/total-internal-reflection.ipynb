    "- Define total internal reflection (TIR) and identify when it occurs.\n",

    "##  D6.5.2 What Is Total Internal Reflection?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Total internal reflection (TIR)** occurs when a light ray attempts to pass from a **more optically dense** medium into a **less dense** one (e.g., glass to air) at an angle too steep to allow refraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instead of bending out, the light **reflects entirely back** into the original medium.\n",
    "- TIR only occurs when:\n",
    "  1. Light is traveling from a medium with **higher** refractive index ($n_1$) to one with **lower** index ($n_2$).\n",
    "  2. The angle of incidence **exceeds the critical angle**.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "n_1 \\sin\\theta_1 = n_2 \\sin\\theta_2\n",
