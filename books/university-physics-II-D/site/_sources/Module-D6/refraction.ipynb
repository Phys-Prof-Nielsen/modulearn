    "## D6.4.1 Learning Goals\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:\n",
    "- Define refraction and explain why it occurs.\n",
    "- State and apply Snell’s Law.\n",
    "- Construct accurate ray diagrams for light passing through interfaces.\n",
    "- Identify everyday examples and consequences of refraction.\n",

    "## D6.4.2 What Is Refraction?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Refraction** is the bending of light as it passes from one medium into another with a different optical density (refractive index).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Caused by a **change in light speed** across the boundary.\n",
    "- Light bends **toward the normal** when entering a more optically dense medium.\n",
    "- Light bends **away from the normal** when entering a less dense medium.\n",
    "\n",
    "The direction of the light ray changes, but its frequency remains constant.\n",

    "Steps:\n",
    "1. Draw the **boundary** between two media.\n",
    "2. Draw the **normal line** perpendicular to the surface at the point of incidence.\n",
    "3. Draw the **incident ray** approaching the boundary.\n",
    "4. Use Snell’s Law to estimate the angle of refraction.\n",
    "5. Draw the **refracted ray**, bending appropriately:\n",
    "   - **Toward the normal** if $n_2 > n_1$\n",
    "   - **Away from the normal** if $n_2 < n_1$\n",

    "- A straw appears bent in a glass of water.\n",
    "- Lenses focus light by refraction through curved surfaces.\n",

    "- Corrective eyeglasses and contact lenses.\n",

    "\n",
    "If $\\theta_1 = 0^\\circ$ (normal incidence), then $\\theta_2 = 0^\\circ$ — the light ray passes straight through with no change in direction.\n",

    "Also, if $n_1 = n_2$, there is no bending regardless of angle.\n",

    "\n",
    "- There exists a **critical angle** $\\theta_c$ beyond which **no refraction** occurs.\n",
