    "## D6.7.1 Learning Goals\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:\n",
    "- Distinguish between converging and diverging lenses.\n",
    "- Construct accurate ray diagrams for image formation.\n",
    "- Apply the thin lens equation and magnification formula.\n",
    "- Understand the role of focal length, object distance, and image distance.\n",

    "\n",
    "## D6.7.2 What Are Thin Lenses?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **lens** is a transparent optical element that bends (refracts) light to form images.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **thin lens** is one where the lens thickness is much smaller than the radii of curvature of its surfaces — so we can treat all refraction as occurring at a single plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types:\n",
    "- **Converging lens (convex)**: brings parallel rays **to a point** (focus)\n",
    "- **Diverging lens (concave)**: spreads parallel rays **away from a point**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **focal point** is the point at which rays initially parallel to the optical axis converge (for a converging lens) or appear to diverge from (for a diverging lens) after passing through the lens. It represents where the lens focuses light and is located a distance equal to the **focal length** from the lens.\n",

    "## D6.7.3 Principal Rays and Ray Diagrams\n",
    "\n",
    "To construct image diagrams, we use three **principal rays**:\n",
    "\n",
    "### For a converging lens:\n",
    "1. **Parallel ray**: enters parallel to the axis, exits through the far focal point.\n",
    "2. **Central ray**: goes through the center of the lens, continues straight.\n",
    "3. **Focal ray**: enters through the near focal point, exits parallel to the axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### For a diverging lens:\n",
    "1. **Parallel ray**: enters parallel, exits as if it came from the near focal point.\n",
    "2. **Central ray**: goes through the center, continues straight.\n",
    "3. **Focal ray**: heads toward the far focal point, exits parallel to the axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the rays **intersect** (or appear to intersect), the **image** is formed.\n",
