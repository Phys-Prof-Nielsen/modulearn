    "## D6.1.1 The Power of Approximation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ray optics**, also known as *geometric optics*, studies how light propagates as straight-line rays. It is based on the **high-frequency approximation** of Maxwell’s equations where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **wavelength of light is much smaller** than the objects it interacts with.\n",
    "- **Wave phenomena** like diffraction and interference are negligible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its simplifications, ray optics is remarkably powerful. It provides **practical, intuitive tools** for analyzing and designing optical systems before diving into wave models.\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin with ray optics because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It provides intuitive and accessible tools for understanding complex optical systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It allows analysis using geometry and simple algebra, rather than needing full electromagnetic theory or quantum electrodynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It sets the stage for more advanced optics (wave optics, quantum optics) by giving us a strong geometric foundation.\n",

    "## D6.1.2 Applications in Physics and Astronomy\n",
    "\n",
    "Ray optics is central to observational and experimental physics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Telescope and Microscope Design**: Understanding how lenses and mirrors gather, bend, and focus light.\n",
    "- **Spectrometers**: Tracing how light disperses and focuses for wavelength analysis.\n",
    "- **Aberration Correction**: Diagnosing and improving optical resolution by understanding lens and mirror imperfections.\n",
    "- **Fermat’s Principle**: Light takes the path of least time — a concept closely related to classical mechanics.\n",
    "- **Space Telescopes**: Missions like *Hubble* and *JWST* rely on precise ray tracing to align optics and resolve distant galaxies.\n",
    "- **Adaptive Optics**: Ground-based observatories use ray optics to adjust for atmospheric distortion in real time.\n",
