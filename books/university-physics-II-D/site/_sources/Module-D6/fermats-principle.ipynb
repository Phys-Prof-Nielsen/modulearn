    "> *The path taken by a ray of light between two points is the one that takes the least time.*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a **variational principle** — it does not prescribe a path, but says that **of all possible paths**, light chooses the one that minimizes travel time.\n",
    "\n",
    "It unifies:\n",
    "- **Straight-line motion** in uniform media\n",
    "- **Reflection** at boundaries\n",
    "- **Refraction** at interfaces\n",

    "## D6.6.3 Application to Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine light traveling from point A to point B, reflecting off a flat mirror.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Out of all the possible points where light could reflect, Fermat’s Principle tells us it picks the one that minimizes total time.\n",
    "- Since the speed of light is the same before and after reflection, this becomes a geometric problem: **minimize total path length**.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you do this minimization, you get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\theta_i = \\theta_r\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, **the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection**.\n",
    "\n",
    "➡️ Fermat’s Principle explains why this rule exists, not just how to use it.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## D6.6.4 Application to Refraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Light goes from point A in medium 1 to point B in medium 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Speeds are different: $v_1$ in medium 1, $v_2$ in medium 2.\n",
    "- Fermat’s Principle: **minimize total travel time** across both media.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since time = distance / speed:\n",
    "- Time in medium 1: $t_1 = \\frac{\\ell_1}{v_1}$\n",
    "- Time in medium 2: $t_2 = \\frac{\\ell_2}{v_2}$\n",
    "- Total time: $T = t_1 + t_2$\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimizing this total with respect to the boundary point leads to:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "n_1 \\sin \\theta_1 = n_2 \\sin \\theta_2\n",

    "## D6.6.5 A Glimpse Ahead: Mechanics and the Least Action Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "Fermat’s Principle is just one member of a larger family of **“least” or “extremal” principles** in physics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **classical mechanics**, there's a similar idea called the **Principle of Least Action**:\n",
    "\n",
    "> A particle moves between two points in space and time in such a way that the **action** is minimized (or more precisely, extremized).\n",
    "\n",
    "The **action** is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S = \\int L \\, dt, \\quad \\text{where } L = T - V\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- $L$ is the **Lagrangian**, the difference between kinetic and potential energy.\n",
    "- The path a particle takes is the one for which $S$ is minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is **analogous** to Fermat’s Principle — instead of minimizing time, particles minimize a quantity related to **energy**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Takeaway**: Nature often “chooses” paths that optimize something. In optics, it’s time. In mechanics, it’s action.\n",

    "## D6.6.6 Deepest Connection: Quantum Physics and the Sum Over All Paths\n",
    "\n",
    "Fermat’s Principle turns out to be not just an approximation — it's a **shadow** of something deeper.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **quantum field theory**, light and particles do not follow a single path.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to **Feynman’s Path Integral Formulation**:\n",
    "> A photon explores **all possible paths** between two points — and the paths “add up” quantum mechanically.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Paths that take much longer or shorter times interfere destructively.\n",
    "- The paths **near the one of least time** interfere constructively and dominate the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "So: what we observe as the **“least-time path”** in classical optics is the result of **quantum interference** of **infinitely many paths**.\n",
    "\n",
    "➡️ Fermat’s Principle is an **emergent classical behavior** that arises from **quantum mechanics**.\n",
    "\n",

    "## D6.6.7 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fermat’s Principle** says light takes the path that minimizes total travel time.\n",
    "- From this single principle, we can derive:\n",
    "  - Law of Reflection: $\\theta_i = \\theta_r$\n",
    "  - Snell’s Law: $n_1 \\sin \\theta_1 = n_2 \\sin \\theta_2$\n",
    "- Fermat’s Principle is part of a broader theme in physics: **optimization principles**.\n",
    "- It connects to:\n",
    "  - **Classical mechanics** via the principle of least action\n",
    "  - **Quantum field theory** via Feynman’s sum-over-paths idea\n",
    "\n",
    "This principle not only explains how light behaves — it gives us a preview of how **deeply unified** physical laws really are.\n",
