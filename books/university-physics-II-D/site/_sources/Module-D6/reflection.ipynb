    "## D6.3.1 Learning Goals\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:\n",
    "- State the law of reflection.\n",
    "- Construct accurate ray diagrams for reflection.\n",
    "- Explain reflection using ray optics principles.\n",
    "- Predict the path of a light ray reflecting off flat and curved surfaces.\n",

    "1. Draw the incident ray approaching the surface.\n",
    "2. At the point of incidence, draw the **normal**.\n",
