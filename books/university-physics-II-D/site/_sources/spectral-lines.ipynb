    "## D8.5.1 Motivation: What Does an Atom’s Light Reveal?\n",
    "\n",
    "When gases are heated or excited by electricity, they emit light — but not a continuous rainbow. Instead, we see **discrete, sharp lines** of color. These **spectral lines** became one of the most precise tools in physics and chemistry.\n",
    "\n",
    "> But why do atoms emit only specific colors of light? What do these lines tell us about the atom?\n",
    "\n",
    "Studying atomic spectra not only revealed the **quantized nature of atomic behavior**, but also helped define the structure of the periodic table and identify elements across the universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr style=\"height:2px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## D8.5.2 Historical Background\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 1800s, physicists and chemists observed that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each element emits its **own unique pattern** of spectral lines when heated.\n",
    "- These patterns can be observed using a **spectroscope**, which separates light by wavelength.\n",
    "\n",
    "This led to the development of **spectroscopy**, a powerful tool for probing atomic structure and composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Major Discoveries:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fraunhofer lines (1814)**: Dark absorption lines in the solar spectrum — first evidence of atomic fingerprints.\n",
    "- **Bunsen and Kirchhoff (1850s)**: Showed that elements emit specific lines and that these could be used to **identify elements**.\n",
    "- **Balmer (1885)**: Found a simple mathematical pattern for visible lines in hydrogen — known as the **Balmer series**.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr style=\"height:2px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## D8.5.3 What Are Atomic Spectra?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main types of spectra:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Continuous Spectrum**  \n",
    "   - Produced by incandescent solids or dense gases.  \n",
    "   - Contains all wavelengths without interruption (e.g. a heated filament).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Emission Line Spectrum**  \n",
    "   - Produced by hot, low-density gases.  \n",
    "   - Contains **bright lines** at specific wavelengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Absorption Line Spectrum**  \n",
    "   - Produced when continuous light passes through a cooler gas.  \n",
    "   - Contains **dark lines** where specific wavelengths are absorbed.\n",
    "\n",
    "> These patterns are like **fingerprints** for each element.\n",

    "## D8.5.4 The Hydrogen Emission Spectrum\n",
    "\n",
    "Hydrogen, the simplest atom, has a surprisingly rich and structured spectrum. When excited, hydrogen emits light only at certain discrete wavelengths — these form what are known as the **hydrogen spectral series**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each **series** corresponds to electron transitions ending in a particular energy level ($n_f$), with the electron falling from a higher energy level ($n_i > n_f$).\n",

    "### The Spectral Series of Hydrogen\n",

    "\\frac{1}{\\lambda} = R_H \\left( \\frac{1}{n_f^2} - \\frac{1}{n_i^2} \\right), \\quad n_i > n_f\n",

    "- $\\lambda$ is the emitted wavelength,\n",
    "- $R_H \\approx 1.097 \\times 10^7 \\ \\text{m}^{-1}$ is the Rydberg constant,\n",

    "### The Balmer Series (Visible Light)\n",
    "\n",

    "- **H-delta** (deep violet) — $n=6 \\to 2$ (~410 nm)\n",
