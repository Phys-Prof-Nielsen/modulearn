    "Magnetic fields were arguable discovered before electric fields and applications such as compasses and permanent magnets were used well before the enlightment period and beginning of modern science. The true nature of magnetic fields was revealed with the development of special relativity. One may notice that physics as of today is explained through four field theories: gravity, electric, weak, and strong. There is no magnetic field theory. In turns out that **magnetic fields are relativistic electric fields due to charges in motion**. Pretty f...... awesome. \n",

It was also shown that the magnetic force would alter the direction of the particle but not its speed, suggesting that the magnetic force was perpendicular to the direction of motion.
